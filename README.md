Objective: Run data analysis on Women's Clothing E-Commerce Review csv file from Internet.

Packages/Libraries Used:
	apache.commons.csv (commons-csv-1.8) (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/download_csv.cgi)
	,Stanford coreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)
	,jfreechart.org http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/

Two Runner class:
	1) SentimentAnalysisRunner <- to run SentimentAnalysis and generate output with Sentiments analysis outcome.
	2) ReviewAnalysisRunner <- take the output from Sentiment analysis, run data analysis, then generate output in txt and plots.
	
Process:
	1) Read csv file and store it in the array list of review class.
	2) Run CoreNLP sentiment analysis on the body of reviews and run the sentiment analysis and store sentiments in the ArrayList.
	3) Ouput the sentiment analysis result in csv file. 
	4) Run data analysis trying to answer the questions we have about the review file.
	5) Output the answers we derived from our analysis in a final output text file and plots.
	
We tried our best to challenge ourself learning new API but also utilize what we have learned from the course:
	1) ArrayList
	2) Reading and Writing File
	3) Exception Handling
	4) HashMap
	5) JUnit Testing
	6) Debugging
	7) Github
	8) Loop
	9) Conditional Statement (if)
	10) Data types (conversion of one data type to another).
	11) Interface
	12)Polymorphism

What we have learned...
	1) Sentiment Analysis itself takes a long time to run. So instead of running all the Java application every single time, 
	we need to break down process to two part: 1. run sentiment analyis and produce csv output | 2. run data analysis based on the output.
	2) Learning new API(or library) is not always easy..
